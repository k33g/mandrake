# :tophat: Mandrake

Mandrake is an application generator for Clever-Cloud:

- it helps you with providing walking skeletons of web applications or addon
- and with creating and pushing your application on Clever-Cloud for the first-time
- when you'll feel confident, you'll be able to add your own templates of creation
